# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
In this analysis, I analyzed data from a fictional automotive manufacturing company "AutosRU". Their newest prototype, MechaCar is suffering from production issues. This analysis will provide insights to mitigate these issues. I used R to perform all the statistical analysis.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
I performed multiple linear regression to see if the following features could predict MPG: </br>
<strong>Vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and AWD </br></br></strong>

From the Pr(>|t|) values, we can see that vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept)  have a significant impact on mpg. The intercept is statistically significant which means that there are variables that we havent considered.
